# Rune Logo

![](RuneFinal.jpg)

[Rune](http://runemag.mit.edu/), MIT's literature and arts journal, was in need of a new logo. I took this opportunity to get my hands dirty in a medium less familiar to me: Motion Design. After creating a static 2D banner, I brought the logo to life with a 10 second animated intro.
